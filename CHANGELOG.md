## [1.0.0] - 2021-01-28

First public release.

The switcheroo technically works, but it's kinda annoying and awkward to use. Please check the [issues](https://gitlab.com/NatoBoram/fabric-switcheroo/issues)
if you want to contribute. Since it's my first Fabric project and my first client-side mod, there's a few things I don't
really know how to do.
